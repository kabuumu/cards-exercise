# Card game exercise
This card game is played with a normal deck of cards, with the joker and face cards removed. The cards remaining are numbered 1-10 for each of the four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades).

## Task 1:
Write a method which takes in a hand of five cards and returns the highest valued card in that hand. If there are two cards with the equal highest value, just return one.

## Task 2:
Write a method which takes in a hand of five cards and returns whether there are any pairs of cards (two or more cards with the same value).

## Task 3:
Write a method which determines how many pairs, three-of-a-kinds or four-of-a-kinds there are in a hand (two, three or four cards with the same numerical value).
If there is a three or four of a kind, only return the highest combination.

## Task 4:
Write a method which determines if a hand contains a straight (five cards in sequential numerical value – e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

## Task 5 (bonus task):
Write a method which takes a hand of five cards and returns the highest scoring combination. The order of scoring is as follows:

* Straight flush – five cards in sequential numerical value where all the cards are the same suit
* Four of a kind – four cards of the same numerical value
* Full house – a pair and a three of a kind in the same hand
* Flush – five cards of the same suit
* Straight – five cards in sequential numerical value
* Three of a kind – three cards of the same numerical value
* Two pairs – two pairs of cards
* Pair – two cards of the same numerical value
